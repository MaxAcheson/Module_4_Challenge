# Retirement Portfolio Automation Solution

This project uses algorithms to provide investment solutions for clientâ€™s retirement portfolios. Using key risk and return metrics such as daily returns, standard deviations, Sharpe ratios and betas, the algorithm will select the Legendary fund or hedge fund with the most investment potential. 

## Technologies

This project utilizes python 3.7 and the pandas library. The project has been constructed in a Jupyter Lab notebook entitled `risk_return_analysis.ipynb`.


## Installation Guide

`python -V`

Next, make sure pandas and Jupyter lab are installed as well by entering the following:

`pip install pandas`

`pip install jupyterlab`
